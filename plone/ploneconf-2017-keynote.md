# Presenter Notes

Hola a tots. I would love to do my talk in catalan, but my catalan is very bad, I will continue in english because my english is much better.

Nevertheless, I will do my best to make my english as bad as possible, because but speaking bad english is a french tradition we need to preserve (even our new president tries to speak a correct english, and I think that's a shame).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Think about our situation

We are developping and maintaining a CMS.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is a CMS?

<img src="./horloge.jpg" />

# Presenter Notes

It looks like a simple feature supported by a precise and quite complex mechanism.

Web frameworks are like that too, right?

But CMS are not just like frameworks.

Maybe let's put it that way...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is a CMS?

<img src="./car.jpg" />

# Presenter Notes

A CMS looks like a simple feature.

And... it is supported by a precise and quite complex mechanism.

Yeah... or let's say...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is a CMS?

<img src="./plant.jpeg" />

# Presenter Notes

It's a simple feature. Yes...

And its mechanism is precise and quite complex.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Does it fly?

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

At some point, the user comes to us, take a good look to our product, and ask:

"Does it fly?"

We: "It is not meant to."

User: "Oh really? well..."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<img src="./horloge.jpg" />

# Presenter Notes

"Your product is quite similar to this, right?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<img src="./flying-watch.jpg" />

# Presenter Notes

"Well, it can fly. Definitely"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<img src="./plant.jpeg" />

# Presenter Notes

But our product is a little more complex than his.

And we start thinking: "Could it fly AND be backward compatible?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ... and we add a new piece in our CMS

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<img src="./rocket.jpg" />

# Presenter Notes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A very large stack

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Zope 2, ZCA, ZODB, CMF, Dexterity, you name it.

Some of them have been around for 15 years.

That's probably half of the age of more than a half of the people here.

But that's clearly more than twice the age of the average JS framework.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This slide is pointless, ignore it

<img src="./formula.png" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A long story

<a href="../teststarwars.mp4" target="_new">Open</a>

# Presenter Notes

For those who discover Plone today, it might look like it always has been that
way. For us, it is more like a saga....

A long time ago, in a GitHub organization far,
far away....

PLONE

Episode VI

A NEW ZOPE

Archetypes empire has vanished. In his absence, the Zope community has risen from the ashes of the CMF and will not rest until the last Python 2.7 egg is migrated to Python 3.
With the support of the Plone API, General Leia Dexterity leads a brave res(t)istance. She is desperate to find her brother Luke ZCA and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the ZODB.
Leia has sent her most daring RESTAPI on a secret mission to the outer frontend world, where an old ally has discovered a clue to JavaScript rendering....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# So, that's what a CMS is

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Coming back to my original question, that's what a CMS is.

Complex features, a large stack, and a long story.

Yeah, a mess...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Facing new challenges

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Remember the "Does it fly?" thing, well it keeps on happening.
What's up at the moment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Moving Plone to Python 3

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

yes, but how?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Zope4, Guillotina?

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Headless CMS

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Offering a full REST API approach.

And what about a GraphQL implementation?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Frontend

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

There is no way to work with web right now without a strong frontend expertise.

You know what? We do not have a lot of frontend expertise in the community?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A bad situation?

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Does it sounds like a bad situation?

What would you think of such a situation on a business project?

You would think it is very bad, and the team would probably be not highly motivated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# So why is Plone alive?

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

So why we, Plone community, can handle this huge project, but a business project could not?

I would like to run our analysis over two axis: emotion and culture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Emotion

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Let's start with emotion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Love

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Last year at the Boston PloneConf, I have developped the idea that someone who writes code feels like a parent (I won't go into detail today)

And an OS community is like a shared parenthood, so we consider ourselves as family.

My talk ended with one word: "Love" as the explanation for the entire OS thing.

Let's dig a little bit from here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Opensource is not business

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

And I prove it:

Business means you're busy.

If you're busy, you're not free.

And not free is not opensource.

Ok, maybe I am playing with words here. But words matter.

Think about the words we use in business...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Disruption

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Why do we use "disruption" instead of "revolution" or even "evolution"?

Probably because the business world is meant to be violent and fast.

People accept that. Business is violent, and it hurts, and that's ok.

Opensource is different, it takes time, it takes to know people, to collaborate over time.

So at the contrary, it heales.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 10x developer

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Start-ups value 10x developers, super-men.

OS values collective.

Collective means the only way to be a 10x dev is to teach 10 developers how to be 2x better.

In business, we usally do not "care" about human resources or human processes, we "manage" them.

It leads to crazy things like: "According this spreadsheet, it seems with 9 couples, we can make one baby in one month"

In OS we are more on the line: "It takes a couple to make a baby, and then it takes a village to raise it"

or "It is easy to make a baby, it is more difficult to make an adult"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Result vs process

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

What I want to highlight here is the corporate world focuses on the result, and we focus on the process.

Why is that?

Because the process provides emotions, the result (the product) does not (it just makes money).

Opensource does not care about money, so it lets us free to focus on what matters, and what matters the most is emotion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sharing emotion

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Let's analyse the OS process

There is a development process of course, which we enjoy, but we could enjoy it in a business context too.

But also a sharing process.

Some of you are not in the Plone community, so you might not know what is a real community.

We are not just sharing code, we are sharing emotion.

That's why contributing feels good. Someone somewhere will appreciate what you gave him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Emotions are strong

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Emotions are not just mental, they are mental and physiologic.

They are what make our mind and our body a single thing, it is the foundation of our unity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Empathy

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

And emotions can be communicated. Love. Hate. Fear. Happiness.

That's what we name empathy, the ability to feel what someone else feel.

Empathy is not something you decide, it is natural, and some studies show it has an important physiologic aspect.

Animals feel empathy.

Because of empathy, emotions are the very first things living beings have been able to share.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Emotion addicts

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

I think we are emotion addicts since we are born.

And that's why human want to share, want to help each others.

Doing OS, we want to be part of something. Like any given group of fan.

Any fan invest time and/or money. For something not useful, not productive.

Just to be part of something. Why? because we don't want to be alone? Not exactly.

Because we need emotions. More emotions. They make us feel better, they make us better persons.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Altruist vs egoist

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

As you know, "we are spirits in a material world" (remember the Police song?).

Our world is ruled by economics principles.

Like the myth of the rational egoistic individual pursuing his own interest and it benefits to the entire society.

A lot of people think that. I think it is the biggest hoax ever.

And those people usally say: "Hey, you know, that's just human nature".

But if you ask them if they are also egoistic regarding the family, they say "no, of course"

But what is the perimeter of your family?

What if it is actually larger than you think?

Consider this:

- we have proof prehistoric people took care of crippled persons

- in countries where you are not paid when you give your blood, we collect more blood

This fraternity, that's human nature.

People are altruists by nature.

That's something our modern world burried very deeply, and opensource makes it resurface.

Because it reminds us that the need for emotions is bigger than the need for money.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Culture

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

So that's **why** the Plone community is a thing, that's **why** Plone survived all along its long life.

But it does not explain **how**.

And the "how" here comes from our culture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Our everyday miracle

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Consider this:

in a Plone site, you can add a Dexterity content in an Archetypes folder

it can trigger an event implemented with Grok, that would display a z3c.form

and gets displayed in Mosaic

and how do you activate that in your web site? just by adding a new egg in our buildout

not a single line of code

Some of the technologies mentioned in this example have more than a 10 years difference.

This is a miracle. The fact it is actually working is crazy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pluggability comes at a price 

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

This miracle is called pluggability.

Pluggability is for more superior than extensibility.

The difference is you just need to *declare* something and the system will integrate it.

Whereas with extensibility, you have to implement how the system will integrate it.

Plone is all about pluggability (buildout, ZCA, etc.).

And that's a key thing for any complex system like a CMS (also true for an ERP).

That's not easy to achieve.

It is based on our tooling and our frameworks, yes.

But it also relies on our common knowledge, our common approach of any given problem.

We are disciplined, we follow our rules.

Would we release a module without tests? no

Would we release a module without i18n? no

Would we release a module with funky CSS selectors? no

That's what I call our culture.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pharamaka

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Those rules and tools and patterns we have been building and using for years are very interesting:

- they are technically effective, we can use them today whenever we need them

- they are also mentally effective, they are memory of the past, memory from the previous contributors and they help us to analyse and solve today's issues

- and they are also barriers: they might be difficult to learn, to use, they make our community less approachable for beginners

that's what we could call a pharmaka in Greek: something which heales, and something which poisons at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Per aspera ad astra

# Presenter Notes

means: through hardships to the stars

Facing difficulty is hard, but it improves us.

what's difference between me and (me - 10 or 15 years)? I know workflow, I know components, I know testing, etc.

And the fact that we know all of us have been facing this difficulty makes us to trust each other.

Just like brothers in arm.

And as a reward for the difficult time, we inherit a strong culture.

Communities which avoid difficulties build weaker culture (and so they need to protect their core).

.fx: titleslide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A diamond mine

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

So I inherit a culture.

I got this knowledge from the community, this knowledge has been built maybe 5 or 10 or 15 years before me.

but actually this knowledge is free, everybody could catch it:

on internet you can learn about testing, about OO patterns, or anything

so this knowledge is in the air, but the community helps to turn it into a crystal.

That's our treasure. A treasure made up of free stuffs, but all together it becomes a treasure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Building a cathedral

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

So ultimately, what are we doing with our love and our culture:

We build a cathedral.

like the Sagrada Familia: conceived by someone who left, continued by new persons, still under construction, and every part makes sense.

And don't worry about the future, as I explained last year, the Plone community is the 
Une communaut√© est un organisme autonome, qui exerce sa volont√© de puissance (au sens de Nietzche, will to power), quand elle rencontre ses limites, elle les repousse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thank you

.fx: titleslide

# Presenter Notes

Ramon: "My idea is to have something mixed from how a community faces the situation we are right now, large stack, maintaining backward compatibility for 12 years, lack of frontend expertise, headless, guillotina, zope 4,... so it can be abstracted in general up to finally explain how great is the plone community :)"
Building a cathedral: like la Sagrada Familia: conceived by someone who left, but still under construction, and every part makes sense.
Disrupting the disruption
dire bonjour en catalan, mais dire que mon catalan est mauvais donc je continue en anglais, m√™me s'il est mauvais aussi, mais c'est une tradition fran√ßaise
the startup world is violent, fast and disruptive, it hurts
opensource takes time, it takes to know people, to collaborate over time, it heales
cura, care vs incuria, free time vs business
startups value 10x developers, super-men. OS value collective. Only way to be a 10x dev is to teach 10 dev how to be 2x better.
Some of you are not in the Plone community, so you might not know what is a real community.

Not just sharing code, we are sharing emotion. Emotions are mental and physiologic, they are what make our mind and our body a single thing, and what make us able to share with others (empathy=ability to feel what someone else feel, it is not a rational decision, it is also physiologic, it also works with animals).
Being part of something, just like fan groups, or cosplay people: they spend a lot of time, is it useful? they don't care, they just want to be part of something, because it improves ourselves and makes us feel good.
Human want to share, want to help (le don de sang payant par exemple, pendant la pr√©histoire, on prenait soin des handicap√©s, etc.), the myth of rational egoistic individual is a hoax. and if you ask those who beleive in it, they say "That's human nature", but ask them if they are also egoistic regarding the family, they say "no, of course", but what is the perimeter of your family? what if it is actually larger than you think? this fraternity, that's human nature.

How Plone survived? Our complex tools and concepts are pharmakas, memory of the past, they are barriers but also helpful to solve today's issues.

Utilser http://makina-corpus.com/blog/metier/archives/quel-prix-devient-vraiment-pluggable
√Ä quel prix devient-on vraiment pluggable ?
Par Eric Brehault ‚Äî publi√© 16/03/2012
Cet article fait suite au mail de Chris McDonough http://groups.google.com/group/pylons-discuss/msg/b19df600ddb8be3f et √† l'analyse qu'en fait Paul Everitt http://pauleveritt.wordpress.com/2011/01/14/chris-mcdonough-on-pluggable-apps/

McDonough explique tr√®s bien la distinction entre extensibilit√© et pluggabilit√©, et il est tout √† fait clairvoyant sur le fait que Pyramid n'offre pas automatiquement la pluggabilit√©.

Dans Zope/Plone, on l'a.
Ce qui est int√©ressant, c'est qu'au d√©part, on ne l'avait pas : Zope au d√©part c'est un syst√®me avec beaucoup de 'rails' (comme il dit), un peu comme Django aujourd'hui, c'est-√†-dire avec un outillage fixe donn√©, mais par contre bas√© sur des concepts plut√¥t du genre de Pyramid.

Aujourd'hui, on en est au point o√π un type de contenu d√©velopp√© en Dexterity peut √™tre ajout√© dans un autre d√©velopp√© en Archetypes, r√©pondre √† un √©v√®nement envoy√© par un composant grok, et √™tre modifi√© dans une browser view z3c.form, et tout cela par la simple gr√¢ce d'avoir install√© les eggs correspondants (autrement dit d'en √©num√©rer les noms dans le buildout.cfg, et sans aucune ligne de code).
Parmi les technos list√©es ici, certaines ont 10 ans d'√©cart.
Pour en arriver l√†, cela n'a pas √©t√© gratuit. Cela s'appuie sur des outils anciens qui ont √©t√© maintenus jusqu'√† aujourd'hui (la ZODB, les CMF, √† titre d'exemple une solution moderne comme Dexterity s'appuie sur les CMF), et sur des outils plus r√©cents tr√®s pointus (la ZCA, GenericSetup, buildout).

Accessoirement, cela a pris 15 ans.

Au cours de ces 15 ann√©es, on a construit deux choses pr√©cieuses :

les outils et les frameworks eux-m√™mes,
la culture qui va avec.
C'est parce que cette culture est tr√®s forte que l'√©cosyst√®me Plone fonctionne si bien. Par exemple, le respect syst√©matique par n'importe quel composant communautaire de la structure CSS g√©n√©rale de Plone ou de son ergonomie ne vient pas √† proprement parler de contraintes techniques, il rel√®ve de la culture globale de la communaut√© Plone et du soin que prend cette communaut√© de son outil.
Et c'est cette volont√© de soin coupl√©e √† la volont√© de s'inscrire dans cette culture qui est le fondement de la pluggabilit√© r√©elle qu'on peut observer dans Plone.

Au fond la technique n'est pas tellement importante, rien n'emp√™che de faire avec Django ou Pyramid la m√™me chose qu'avec Zope/Plone (d'ailleurs, on trouve tout ce qu'il faut dans Pyramid pour suivre la m√™me voie que Zope si on le souhaitait). Ce n'est pas la question. Ce n'est pas que ce soit possible de le faire qui compte, ce qui compte c'est que toute une communaut√© le fasse.
