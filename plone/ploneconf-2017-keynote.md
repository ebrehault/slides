We are developping and maintaining a CMS.

# What is a CMS?

# Presenter Notes

It looks like a simple feature supported by a precise and quite complex mechanism.
Web frameworks are like that too, right?
But CMS are not just like frameworks.

And... it is supported by a precise and quite complex mechanism.
Yeah... or let's say...

It's a simple feature. Yes...

Zope 2, ZCA, ZODB, CMF, Dexterity, you name it
